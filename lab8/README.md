# Usage
Synthesize the design using the .qsf file.

There is no testbench yet for this design.

# Design 
This design implements a 4-digit counter on the seven segment displays of the DE10-Lite Board.

Push button (KEY0) is used to reset the counter.

SW0 starts/stops the counter.

SW1 controls up/down counting.

SW2 controls speed of counter (1-second rate/50-millisecond rate).

# Dependencies
In order to properly synthesize, lab3 and lab7 must be complete and in the directory tree. 

Thus, it is best to simply insert the lab8 folder into the existing ECE 2613 lab structure.
